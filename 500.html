	<ul>
		<li><strong>500</strong><br>A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.</li>
		<li><strong>501</strong><br>The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).</li>
		<li><strong>502</strong><br>The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server</li>
		<li><strong>503</strong><br>The server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.</li>
		<li><strong>504</strong><br>The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.</li>
		<li><strong>505</strong><br>The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.</li>
